# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis-using-Python
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multi-year coffee shop sales data to uncover key business insights. Using Python, the dataset was cleaned, merged, and analyzed to identify sales trends, customer preferences, and seasonal variations. Advanced data visualization techniques with Seaborn and Matplotlib were implemented to represent revenue distribution and product performance effectively. The insights derived from this analysis help optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts for better business decision-making.
